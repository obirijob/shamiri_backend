Hello, We are using mysql as the provider. You can change to anyother in the prisma configurations.
Change this is schema.prisma

```javascript
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}
```

and also in the .env file DATABASE_URL

```env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:mypassword@localhost:3306/journal"
SECRET_KEY="mysecretkey"
```

These are the instructions to create a working backend service.

1. Clone this project
   Install the necessary libraries.
   run `npm install`
2. Create a `.env file` with the following information
   DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:mypassword@localhost:3306/journal"
   SECRET_KEY="mysecretkey"

   That is going to create connect to a mysqlconnection.
   The other secret key is used by jwt to create tokens

3. Initialize prism by running `npx prisma generate` this will generate a schema
4. Run `npm prisma migrate` and follow the instructions to migrate your db.
5. Run `npm run seed` this will execute a command to seed your db with some data.
   Some of the data includes a user
   username: obirijob and password : 7554
   and some other journals and their categories
6. Run `npm start` and it will start on port 2000 or `npm watch` if you want to do some development while watching
